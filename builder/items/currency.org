* Currency
** Coins
The most basic type of treasure is money, including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp). Fifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound.
| Coin     |   Cp |   Sp |   Ep | Gp    | Pp     |
| Copper   |    1 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/1000 |
| Silver   |   10 |    1 |  1/5 | 1/10  | 1/10   |
| Electrum |   50 |    5 |    1 | 1/2   | 1/20   |
| Gold     |  100 |   10 |    2 | 1     | 1/10   |
| Platinum | 1000 |  100 |   50 | 10    | 1      |
** Trade Goods
Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).

Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant chips to various ports, or to buy and sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.
