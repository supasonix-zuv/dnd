1. eldritch blast  
   + Casting Time: 1 action
   + Range: 120 feet
   + Components: V, S

   +A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.
   +At Higher Levels. The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

1. cone of cold
   + Casting Time: 1 action
   + Range: Self (60-foot cone)
   + Components: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)
   + Duration: Instantaneous
   + A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.
   + At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

* additional info
** Grovel, Cower, and Beg
***  As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
** Pack Tactics
*** You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
** Sunlight Sensitivity
*** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.


To markup text in Org, simply surround it with one or more marker characters.
*Bold*, /italic/ and _underline_ are fairly intuitive, and the ability to use
+strikethrough+ is a plus.  You can _/*combine*/_ the basic markup in any
order, however ~code~ and =verbatim= need to be the *_~inner-most~_* markers
if they are present since their contents are interpreted =_literally_=.
