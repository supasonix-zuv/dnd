<h1 id="toc0"><span>Backstory</span></h1>
<p>A character's story begins with determining the region where they were born, the job they had before becoming an adventurer, their social status, the settlement where they grew up, and their family relationships. As this backstory develops, the character will gain allies and rivals, as well as learn some of the fateful moments that set them on the path of adventure.</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Homelands</span></h2>
<p>The Sword Coast and the North can be divided into five major political regions, each of which are described in chapter 2 of the Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide. These regions are the Lords’ Alliance, the Dwarfholds of the North, the Island Kingdoms, Independent Realms, and the Underdark.</p>
<p>To determine your homeland, roll 1d100 on the Homelands table below. You may decide your character was born in one region but grew up in another. In that case, roll twice to determine the land of your birth and the land you were ultimately raised in.</p>

<h2 id="toc11"><span>Prophecy</span></h2>
<p>Write down three aspirations or goals you have for your character, and which you want to achieve over the course of the campaign. A prophecy goal should have two parts. First is the goal that your character wants to attain. Second is a sense of what complication might ensue once the goal is met - for good or ill.</p>
<p>One of your prophecy goals should be an immediate goal, one should be long term, and one should be a goal that concludes your character arc at the end of the campaign. You don't have to choose all three goals at the start.</p>
<p>If you're looking for prophecy goals for your character, you can roll on the Prophecy Inspirations table for a random goal and a consequence of that goal. If this goal isn't a perfect fit for your character, you can fine-tune it or roll again to find one that works better.</p>
